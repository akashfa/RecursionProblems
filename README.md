# RecursionProblems
Recursion in Java (and in programming in general) is a technique where a method calls itself to solve a problem. Let's break down how recursion works in Java step by step:

1. Base Case
Recursion requires a base case, which acts as the exit condition to stop the recursive calls. It prevents infinite recursion.

2. Recursive Step
There's a recursive call inside the method itself with modified parameters, bringing the problem closer to the base case. Each subsequent call should simplify the problem until it reaches the base case.
